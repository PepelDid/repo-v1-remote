What should I do next?
----------------------

If you want to use PuTTY to connect to other computers, or use PSFTP
to transfer files, you should just be able to run them from the
Start menu.



(Note that a Command Prompt that was already open before you ran the
installer will not have inherited the update of PATH.)

What do I do if it doesn't work?
